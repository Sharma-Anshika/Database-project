Schedule Database of Students
Based on the business rules and assumptions, an ER diagram was created for the student schedule database of the student details, course details, enrollment, reference book and instructor details.
Normalization of the data model was done from 1NF to 3NF.
Final database was created and then different queries were written based on this data model in Microsoft SQL server for extracting the answers of sample questions.
